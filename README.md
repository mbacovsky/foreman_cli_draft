Foreman CLI design draft
========================

This is my attempt to create outline of CLI client for the Foreman. The Foreman project has Ruby as its main langauage, so I choosed to explore the options Ruby world is offering to complete this task.

My initial requirements are as follows:

 - [x] implemented in Ruby
 - [x] Git-like subcomands in CLI app
 - [x] system shell autocompletion of commands and options
 - [x] shell-like environment with autocompletion and history where the commands can be run directly
 - [x] commands extensible via plugins
 - [x] some way to wrap current Katello CLI commands and make it possible to have one CLI client for both
