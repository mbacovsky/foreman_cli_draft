* As a CLI user I would like to use Signo for authentication
* As a CLI user I would like to choose from multiple secrets to sign my request
* As a CLI user I would like to have set the last requested secret as a default
* As a CLI user I would like to set the default secret
* As a CLI user I would like to see list of my secrets with their expiration and issue dates
* As a CLI user I would like to set expiration in the request (e.g. longer for cron jobs)
* As a CLI user I would like to limit scope of actions the secret authorizes me to do
* As a CLI user I would like to be able to disable the secret
